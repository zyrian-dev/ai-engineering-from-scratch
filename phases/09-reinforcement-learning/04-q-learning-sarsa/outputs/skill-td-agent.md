Given a tabular or small-feature environment, output:

1. Algorithm. Q-learning / SARSA / Expected SARSA / n-step variant. One-sentence reason tied to on-policy vs off-policy and variance.
2. Hyperparameters. α, γ, ε, decay schedule.
3. Initialization. Q_0 value (optimistic vs zero) and justification.
4. Convergence diagnostic. Target learning curve, `|Q - Q*|` check if DP is possible.
5. Deployment caveat. How will exploration behave at inference? Is SARSA's conservatism needed?

Refuse to apply tabular TD to state spaces > 10⁶. Refuse to ship a Q-learning agent without a max-bias caveat. Flag any agent trained with ε held at 1.0 throughout (no exploitation phase).
