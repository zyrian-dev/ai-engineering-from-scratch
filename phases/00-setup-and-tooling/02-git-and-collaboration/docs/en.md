# Git & Collaboration

> Version control is not optional. Every experiment, every model, every lesson you build here gets tracked.

**Type:** Learn
**Languages:** --
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0, Lesson 01
**Time:** ~30 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Configure git identity and use the daily workflow of add, commit, and push
- Create and merge branches for isolated experiments without breaking main
- Write a `.gitignore` that excludes model checkpoints and large binary files
- Navigate the commit history with `git log` to understand project evolution

## The Problem

You're about to write hundreds of code files across 20 phases. Without version control you will lose work, break things you can't undo, and have no way to collaborate with others.

Git is the tool. GitHub is where the code lives. This lesson covers what you need for this course and nothing more.

## The Concept

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WD as Working Directory
    participant SA as Staging Area
    participant LR as Local Repo
    participant R as Remote (GitHub)
    WD->>SA: git add
    SA->>LR: git commit
    LR->>R: git push
    R->>LR: git fetch
    LR->>WD: git pull
```

Three things to remember:
1. Save often (`git commit`)
2. Push to remote (`git push`)
3. Branch for experiments (`git checkout -b experiment`)

## Build It

### Step 1: Configure git

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### Step 2: The daily workflow

```bash
git status
git add file.py
git commit -m "Add perceptron implementation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Branching for experiments

```bash
git checkout -b experiment/new-optimizer

# ... make changes, commit ...

git checkout main
git merge experiment/new-optimizer
```

### Step 4: Working with this course repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitg00/ai-engineering-from-scratch.git
cd ai-engineering-from-scratch

git checkout -b my-progress
# work through lessons, commit your code
git push origin my-progress
```

## Use It

For this course, you need exactly these commands:

| Command | When |
|---------|------|
| `git clone` | Get the course repo |
| `git add` + `git commit` | Save your work |
| `git push` | Back it up to GitHub |
| `git checkout -b` | Try something without breaking main |
| `git log --oneline` | See what you've done |

That's it. You don't need rebase, cherry-pick, or submodules for this course.

## Exercises

1. Clone this repo, create a branch called `my-progress`, make a file, commit it, push it
2. Create a `.gitignore` that excludes model checkpoint files (`.pt`, `.pth`, `.safetensors`)
3. Look at the commit history of this repo with `git log --oneline` and read how lessons were added

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Commit | "Saving" | A snapshot of your entire project at a point in time |
| Branch | "A copy" | A pointer to a commit that moves forward as you work |
| Merge | "Combining code" | Taking changes from one branch and applying them to another |
| Remote | "The cloud" | A copy of your repo hosted somewhere else (GitHub, GitLab) |
