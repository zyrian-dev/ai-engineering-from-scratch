# APIs & Keys

> Every AI API works the same way: send a request, get a response. The details change, the pattern doesn't.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0, Lesson 01
**Time:** ~30 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Store API keys securely using environment variables and `.env` files
- Make an LLM API call using both the Anthropic Python SDK and raw HTTP
- Compare SDK-based and raw HTTP request/response formats for debugging
- Identify and handle common API errors including authentication and rate limits

## The Problem

Starting from Phase 11, you'll call LLM APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). In Phase 13-16 you'll build agents that use these APIs in loops. You need to know how API keys work, how to store them safely, and how to make your first API call.

## The Concept

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Your Code
    participant S as API Server
    C->>S: HTTP Request (with API key)
    S->>C: HTTP Response (JSON)
```

Every API call has:
1. An endpoint (URL)
2. An API key (authentication)
3. A request body (what you want)
4. A response body (what you get back)

## Build It

### Step 1: Store API keys safely

Never put API keys in code. Use environment variables.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Or use a `.env` file (add it to `.gitignore`):

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Step 2: First API call (Python)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=256,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is a neural network in one sentence?"}]
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

### Step 3: First API call (TypeScript)

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  max_tokens: 256,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is a neural network in one sentence?" }],
});

console.log(response.content[0].text);
```

### Step 4: Raw HTTP (no SDK)

```python
import os
import urllib.request
import json

url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],
    "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
}
body = json.dumps({
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a neural network in one sentence?"}],
}).encode()

req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=body, headers=headers, method="POST")
with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as resp:
    result = json.loads(resp.read())
    print(result["content"][0]["text"])
```

This is what the SDKs do under the hood. Understanding the raw HTTP call helps when debugging.

## Use It

For this course:

| API | When you need it | Free tier |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| Anthropic (Claude) | Phases 11-16 (agents, tools) | $5 credit on signup |
| OpenAI | Phase 11 (comparison) | $5 credit on signup |
| Hugging Face | Phases 4-10 (models, datasets) | Free |

You don't need all of them right now. Set them up when the lesson requires it.

## Ship It

This lesson produces:
- `outputs/prompt-api-troubleshooter.md` - diagnose common API errors

## Exercises

1. Get an Anthropic API key and make your first API call
2. Try the raw HTTP version and compare the response format to the SDK version
3. Intentionally use a wrong API key and read the error message

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| API key | "Password for the API" | A unique string that identifies your account and authorizes requests |
| Rate limit | "They're throttling me" | Maximum requests per minute/hour to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage |
| Token | "A word" (in API context) | A billing unit: input and output tokens are counted and charged separately |
| Streaming | "Real-time responses" | Getting the response word by word instead of waiting for the full response |
