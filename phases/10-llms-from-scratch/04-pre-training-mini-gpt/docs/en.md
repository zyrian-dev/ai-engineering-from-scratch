# Pre-Training a Mini GPT (124M Parameters)

> GPT-2 Small has 124 million parameters. That's 12 transformer layers, 12 attention heads, and 768-dimensional embeddings. You can train it from scratch on a single GPU in a few hours. Most people never do this. They use pre-trained checkpoints. But if you don't train one yourself, you don't actually understand what's happening inside the model you're building products on.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python (with numpy)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 10, Lessons 01-03 (Tokenizers, Building a Tokenizer, Data Pipelines)
**Time:** ~120 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Implement the full GPT-2 architecture (124M parameters) from scratch: token embeddings, positional embeddings, transformer blocks, and the language model head
- Train a GPT model on a text corpus using next-token prediction with cross-entropy loss
- Implement autoregressive text generation with temperature sampling and top-k/top-p filtering
- Monitor training loss curves and validate that the model learns coherent language patterns

## The Problem

You know what a transformer is. You have read the diagrams. You can recite "attention is all you need" and draw boxes labeled "Multi-Head Attention" on a whiteboard.

None of that means you understand what happens when a model generates text.

There are 124,438,272 parameters in GPT-2 Small (with weight tying). Every single one of them was set by running a training loop: forward pass, compute loss, backward pass, update weights. Twelve transformer blocks. Twelve attention heads per block. A 768-dimensional embedding space. A vocabulary of 50,257 tokens. Every time the model generates a token, all 124 million parameters participate in a single matrix multiplication chain that takes a sequence of token IDs and produces a probability distribution over the next token.

If you have never built this yourself, you are working with a black box. You can use the API. You can fine-tune. But when something goes wrong -- when the model hallucinates, when it repeats itself, when it refuses to follow instructions -- you have no mental model for *why*.

This lesson builds GPT-2 Small from scratch. Not in PyTorch. In numpy. Every matrix multiplication is visible. Every gradient is computed by your code. You will see exactly how 124 million numbers conspire to predict the next word.

## The Concept

### The GPT Architecture

GPT is an autoregressive language model. "Autoregressive" means it generates one token at a time, each conditioned on all previous tokens. The architecture is a stack of transformer decoder blocks.

Here is the full computation graph from token IDs to next-token probabilities:

1. Token IDs come in. Shape: (batch_size, seq_len).
2. Token embedding lookup. Each ID maps to a 768-dimensional vector. Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, 768).
3. Position embedding lookup. Each position (0, 1, 2, ...) maps to a 768-dimensional vector. Same shape.
4. Add token embeddings + position embeddings.
5. Pass through 12 transformer blocks.
6. Final layer normalization.
7. Linear projection to vocabulary size. Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size).
8. Softmax to get probabilities.

That is the entire model. No convolutions. No recurrence. Just embeddings, attention, feedforward networks, and layer norms stacked 12 times.

```

### The Transformer Block

Each of the 12 blocks follows the same pattern. Pre-norm architecture (GPT-2 uses pre-norm, not post-norm like the original transformer):

1. LayerNorm
2. Multi-Head Self-Attention
3. Residual connection (add input back)
4. LayerNorm
5. Feed-Forward Network (MLP)
6. Residual connection (add input back)

The residual connections are critical. Without them, gradients vanish by the time they reach block 1 during backpropagation. With them, gradients can flow directly from the loss to any layer through the "skip" path. This is why you can stack 12, 32, or even 96 blocks (GPT-4 is rumored to use 120).

### Attention: The Core Mechanism

Self-attention lets every token look at every previous token and decide how much to attend to each one. Here is the math.

For each token position, compute three vectors from the input:
- **Query (Q)**: "What am I looking for?"
- **Key (K)**: "What do I contain?"
- **Value (V)**: "What information do I carry?"

```
Q = input @ W_q    (768 -> 768)
K = input @ W_k    (768 -> 768)
V = input @ W_v    (768 -> 768)

attention_scores = Q @ K^T / sqrt(d_k)
attention_scores = mask(attention_scores)   # causal mask: -inf for future positions
attention_weights = softmax(attention_scores)
output = attention_weights @ V
```

The causal mask is what makes GPT autoregressive. Position 5 can attend to positions 0-5 but not 6, 7, 8, and so on. This prevents the model from "cheating" by looking at future tokens during training.

**Multi-head attention** splits the 768-dimensional space into 12 heads of 64 dimensions each. Each head learns a different attention pattern. One head might track syntactic relationships (subject-verb agreement). Another might track semantic similarity (synonyms). Another might track positional proximity (nearby words). The outputs from all 12 heads are concatenated and projected back to 768 dimensions.

```

The division by sqrt(d_k) -- sqrt(64) = 8 -- is scaling. Without it, the dot products grow large for high-dimensional vectors, pushing softmax into regions where gradients are nearly zero. This was one of the key insights in the original "Attention Is All You Need" paper.

### KV Cache: Why Inference Is Fast

During training, you process the entire sequence at once. During inference, you generate one token at a time. Without optimization, generating token N requires recomputing attention for all N-1 previous tokens. That is O(N^2) per generated token, or O(N^3) total for a sequence of length N.

KV Cache solves this. After computing K and V for each token, store them. When generating token N+1, you only need to compute Q for the new token and look up the cached K and V from all previous tokens. This reduces per-token cost from O(N) to O(1) for the K and V computation. The attention score calculation is still O(N) because you attend to all previous positions, but you avoid redundant matrix multiplications on the input.

For GPT-2 with 12 layers and 12 heads, the KV cache stores 2 (K + V) x 12 layers x 12 heads x 64 dims = 18,432 values per token. For a 1024-token sequence, that is about 75MB in FP32. For Llama 3 405B with 128 layers, the KV cache for a single sequence can exceed 10GB. This is why long-context inference is memory-bound.

### Prefill vs Decode: Two Phases of Inference

When you send a prompt to an LLM, inference happens in two distinct phases.

**Prefill** processes your entire prompt in parallel. All tokens are known, so the model can compute attention for all positions simultaneously. This phase is compute-bound -- the GPU is doing matrix multiplications at full throughput. For a 1000-token prompt on an A100, prefill takes roughly 20-50ms.

**Decode** generates tokens one at a time. Each new token depends on all previous tokens. This phase is memory-bound -- the bottleneck is reading the model weights and KV cache from GPU memory, not the matrix math itself. The GPU's compute cores sit mostly idle waiting for memory reads. For GPT-2, each decode step takes about the same time regardless of how many FLOPs the matmuls require, because memory bandwidth is the constraint.

This distinction matters for production systems. Prefill throughput scales with GPU compute (more FLOPS = faster prefill). Decode throughput scales with memory bandwidth (faster memory = faster decode). That is why NVIDIA's H100 focused on memory bandwidth improvements over the A100 -- it directly speeds up token generation.

```mermaid

    subgraph Prefill["Phase 1: Prefill"]
        direction TB
        P1["Full prompt\n(all tokens known)"]

### The Training Loop

Training an LLM is next-token prediction. Given tokens [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1], predict tokens [1, 2, 3, ..., N]. The loss function is cross-entropy between the model's predicted probability distribution and the actual next token.

One training step:

1. **Forward pass**: Run the batch through all 12 blocks. Get logits (pre-softmax scores) for each position.
2. **Compute loss**: Cross-entropy between logits and target tokens (the input shifted by one position).
3. **Backward pass**: Compute gradients for all 124M parameters using backpropagation.
4. **Optimizer step**: Update weights. GPT-2 uses Adam with learning rate warmup and cosine decay.

The learning rate schedule matters more than you might expect. GPT-2 warms up from 0 to the peak learning rate over the first 2,000 steps, then decays following a cosine curve. Starting with a high learning rate causes the model to diverge. Keeping a constant high rate causes oscillation in later training. The warmup-then-decay pattern is used by every major LLM.

### GPT-2 Small: The Numbers

| Component | Shape | Parameters |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Token embeddings | (50257, 768) | 38,597,376 |
| Position embeddings | (1024, 768) | 786,432 |
| Per-block attention (W_q, W_k, W_v, W_out) | 4 x (768, 768) | 2,359,296 |
| Per-block FFN (up + down) | (768, 3072) + (3072, 768) | 4,718,592 |
| Per-block LayerNorms (2x) | 2 x 768 x 2 | 3,072 |
| Final LayerNorm | 768 x 2 | 1,536 |
| **Total per block** | | **7,080,960** |
| **Total (12 blocks)** | | **85,054,464 + 39,383,808 = 124,438,272** |

The output projection (logits head) shares weights with the token embedding matrix. This is called weight tying -- it reduces the parameter count by 38M and improves performance because it forces the model to use the same representation space for input and output.

## Build It

### Step 1: Embedding Layer

Token embeddings map each of the 50,257 possible tokens to a 768-dimensional vector. Position embeddings add information about where each token sits in the sequence. The two are summed.

```python
import numpy as np

class Embedding:
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_dim, max_seq_len):
        self.token_embed = np.random.randn(vocab_size, embed_dim) * 0.02
        self.pos_embed = np.random.randn(max_seq_len, embed_dim) * 0.02

    def forward(self, token_ids):
        seq_len = token_ids.shape[-1]
        tok_emb = self.token_embed[token_ids]
        pos_emb = self.pos_embed[:seq_len]
        return tok_emb + pos_emb
```

The 0.02 standard deviation for initialization comes from the GPT-2 paper. Too large and the initial forward passes produce extreme values that destabilize training. Too small and the initial outputs are nearly identical for all inputs, making early gradient signals useless.

### Step 2: Self-Attention with Causal Mask

Single-head attention first. The causal mask sets future positions to negative infinity before softmax, ensuring each position can only attend to itself and earlier positions.

```python
def attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    d_k = Q.shape[-1]
    scores = Q @ K.transpose(0, -1, -2 if Q.ndim == 4 else 1) / np.sqrt(d_k)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores + mask
    weights = np.exp(scores - scores.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True))
    weights = weights / weights.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    return weights @ V
```

The softmax implementation subtracts the maximum before exponentiating. Without this, exp(large_number) overflows to infinity. This is a numerical stability trick that does not change the output because softmax(x - c) = softmax(x) for any constant c.

### Step 3: Multi-Head Attention

Split the 768-dimensional input into 12 heads of 64 dimensions each. Each head computes attention independently. Concatenate the results and project back to 768 dimensions.

```python
class MultiHeadAttention:
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads
        self.W_q = np.random.randn(embed_dim, embed_dim) * 0.02
        self.W_k = np.random.randn(embed_dim, embed_dim) * 0.02
        self.W_v = np.random.randn(embed_dim, embed_dim) * 0.02
        self.W_out = np.random.randn(embed_dim, embed_dim) * 0.02

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        batch, seq_len, d = x.shape
        Q = (x @ self.W_q).reshape(batch, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)
        K = (x @ self.W_k).reshape(batch, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)
        V = (x @ self.W_v).reshape(batch, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)

        scores = Q @ K.transpose(0, 1, 3, 2) / np.sqrt(self.head_dim)
        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores + mask
        weights = np.exp(scores - scores.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True))
        weights = weights / weights.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        attn_out = weights @ V

        attn_out = attn_out.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3).reshape(batch, seq_len, d)
        return attn_out @ self.W_out
```

The reshape-transpose-reshape dance is the most confusing part of multi-head attention. Here is what happens: the (batch, seq_len, 768) tensor becomes (batch, seq_len, 12, 64), then (batch, 12, seq_len, 64). Now each of the 12 heads has its own (seq_len, 64) matrix to run attention on. After attention, we reverse the process: (batch, 12, seq_len, 64) becomes (batch, seq_len, 12, 64) becomes (batch, seq_len, 768).

### Step 4: Transformer Block

One complete transformer block: LayerNorm, multi-head attention with residual, LayerNorm, feedforward with residual.

```python
class LayerNorm:
    def __init__(self, dim, eps=1e-5):
        self.gamma = np.ones(dim)
        self.beta = np.zeros(dim)
        self.eps = eps

    def forward(self, x):
        mean = x.mean(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        var = x.var(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        return self.gamma * (x - mean) / np.sqrt(var + self.eps) + self.beta


class FeedForward:
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, ff_dim):
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(embed_dim, ff_dim) * 0.02
        self.b1 = np.zeros(ff_dim)
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(ff_dim, embed_dim) * 0.02
        self.b2 = np.zeros(embed_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        h = x @ self.W1 + self.b1
        h = np.maximum(0, h)  # GELU approximation: ReLU for simplicity
        return h @ self.W2 + self.b2


class TransformerBlock:
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim):
        self.ln1 = LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.attn = MultiHeadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.ln2 = LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.ffn = FeedForward(embed_dim, ff_dim)

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        x = x + self.attn.forward(self.ln1.forward(x), mask)
        x = x + self.ffn.forward(self.ln2.forward(x))
        return x
```

The feedforward network expands the 768-dimensional input to 3,072 dimensions (4x), applies a nonlinearity, then projects back to 768. This expansion-contraction pattern gives the model a "wider" internal representation to work with at each position. GPT-2 uses GELU activation, but we use ReLU here for simplicity -- the difference is minor for understanding the architecture.

### Step 5: Full GPT Model

Stack 12 transformer blocks. Add the embedding layer at the front and the output projection at the back.

```python
class MiniGPT:
    def __init__(self, vocab_size=50257, embed_dim=768, num_heads=12,
                 num_layers=12, max_seq_len=1024, ff_dim=3072):
        self.embedding = Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim, max_seq_len)
        self.blocks = [
            TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim)
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ]
        self.ln_f = LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim

    def forward(self, token_ids):
        seq_len = token_ids.shape[-1]
        mask = np.triu(np.full((seq_len, seq_len), -1e9), k=1)

        x = self.embedding.forward(token_ids)
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block.forward(x, mask)
        x = self.ln_f.forward(x)

        logits = x @ self.embedding.token_embed.T
        return logits

    def count_parameters(self):
        total = 0
        total += self.embedding.token_embed.size
        total += self.embedding.pos_embed.size
        for block in self.blocks:
            total += block.attn.W_q.size + block.attn.W_k.size
            total += block.attn.W_v.size + block.attn.W_out.size
            total += block.ffn.W1.size + block.ffn.b1.size
            total += block.ffn.W2.size + block.ffn.b2.size
            total += block.ln1.gamma.size + block.ln1.beta.size
            total += block.ln2.gamma.size + block.ln2.beta.size
        total += self.ln_f.gamma.size + self.ln_f.beta.size
        return total
```

Notice the weight tying: `logits = x @ self.embedding.token_embed.T`. The output projection reuses the token embedding matrix (transposed). This is not just a parameter-saving trick. It means the model uses the same vector space for understanding tokens (embeddings) and predicting them (output).

### Step 6: Training Loop

For a real training run on 124M parameters, you would need a GPU and PyTorch. This training loop demonstrates the mechanics on a small model that runs in pure numpy. We use a tiny model (4 layers, 4 heads, 128 dims) to make it tractable.

```python
def cross_entropy_loss(logits, targets):
    batch, seq_len, vocab_size = logits.shape
    logits_flat = logits.reshape(-1, vocab_size)
    targets_flat = targets.reshape(-1)

    max_logits = logits_flat.max(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    log_softmax = logits_flat - max_logits - np.log(
        np.exp(logits_flat - max_logits).sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    )

    loss = -log_softmax[np.arange(len(targets_flat)), targets_flat].mean()
    return loss


def train_mini_gpt(text, vocab_size=256, embed_dim=128, num_heads=4,
                   num_layers=4, seq_len=64, num_steps=200, lr=3e-4):
    tokens = np.array(list(text.encode("utf-8")[:2048]))
    model = MiniGPT(
        vocab_size=vocab_size, embed_dim=embed_dim, num_heads=num_heads,
        num_layers=num_layers, max_seq_len=seq_len, ff_dim=embed_dim * 4
    )

    print(f"Model parameters: {model.count_parameters():,}")
    print(f"Training tokens: {len(tokens):,}")
    print(f"Config: {num_layers} layers, {num_heads} heads, {embed_dim} dims")
    print()

    for step in range(num_steps):
        start_idx = np.random.randint(0, max(1, len(tokens) - seq_len - 1))
        batch_tokens = tokens[start_idx:start_idx + seq_len + 1]

        input_ids = batch_tokens[:-1].reshape(1, -1)
        target_ids = batch_tokens[1:].reshape(1, -1)

        logits = model.forward(input_ids)
        loss = cross_entropy_loss(logits, target_ids)

        if step % 20 == 0:
            print(f"Step {step:4d} | Loss: {loss:.4f}")

    return model
```

The loss starts near ln(vocab_size) -- for a 256-token byte-level vocabulary, that is ln(256) = 5.55. A random model assigns equal probability to every token. As training progresses, the loss drops because the model learns to predict common patterns: "th" after "t", space after a period, and so on.

In production, you would use Adam optimizer with gradient accumulation, learning rate warmup, and gradient clipping. The forward-pass-loss-backward-update loop is identical. The optimizer is more sophisticated.

### Step 7: Text Generation

Generation uses the trained model to predict one token at a time. Each prediction is sampled from the output distribution (or taken greedily as the argmax).

```python
def generate(model, prompt_tokens, max_new_tokens=100, temperature=0.8):
    tokens = list(prompt_tokens)
    seq_len = model.embedding.pos_embed.shape[0]

    for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
        context = np.array(tokens[-seq_len:]).reshape(1, -1)
        logits = model.forward(context)
        next_logits = logits[0, -1, :]

        next_logits = next_logits / temperature
        probs = np.exp(next_logits - next_logits.max())
        probs = probs / probs.sum()

        next_token = np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)
        tokens.append(next_token)

    return tokens
```

Temperature controls randomness. Temperature 1.0 uses the raw distribution. Temperature 0.5 sharpens it (more deterministic -- the model picks its top choices more often). Temperature 1.5 flattens it (more random -- low-probability tokens get a bigger chance). Temperature 0.0 is greedy decoding (always pick the highest probability token).

The `tokens[-seq_len:]` window is necessary because the model has a maximum context length (1024 for GPT-2). Once you exceed it, you must drop the oldest tokens. This is the "context window" that everyone talks about.

### Full Training and Generation Demo

```python
corpus = """The transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing.
Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
Self-attention computes relationships between all pairs of positions in a sequence.
Multi-head attention splits the representation into multiple subspaces.
Each attention head can learn different types of relationships.
The feedforward network provides nonlinear transformations at each position.
Residual connections enable gradient flow through deep networks.
Layer normalization stabilizes training by normalizing activations.
Position embeddings give the model information about token ordering.
The causal mask ensures autoregressive generation during training.
Pre-training on large text corpora teaches the model general language understanding.
Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained model to specific downstream tasks."""

model = train_mini_gpt(corpus, num_steps=200)

prompt = list("The transformer".encode("utf-8"))
output_tokens = generate(model, prompt, max_new_tokens=100, temperature=0.8)
generated_text = bytes(output_tokens).decode("utf-8", errors="replace")
print(f"\nGenerated: {generated_text}")
```

On a small corpus with a small model, the generated text will be semi-coherent at best. It will learn some byte-level patterns from the training text but cannot generalize the way GPT-2 does with 40GB of training data and the full 124M parameter architecture. The point is not the output quality. The point is that you can trace every step: embedding lookup, attention computation, feedforward transformation, logit projection, softmax, and sampling. Every operation is visible.

## Ship It

This lesson produces `outputs/prompt-gpt-architecture-analyzer.md` -- a prompt that analyzes the architecture choices in any GPT-style model. Feed it a model card or technical report and it breaks down the parameter allocation, attention design, and scaling decisions.

## Exercises

1. Modify the model to use 24 layers and 16 heads instead of 12/12. Count the parameters. How does doubling the depth compare to doubling the width (embedding dimension)?

2. Implement the GELU activation function (GELU(x) = x * 0.5 * (1 + erf(x / sqrt(2)))) and replace the ReLU in the feedforward network. Run training for 500 steps with each activation and compare the final loss.

3. Add a KV cache to the generation function. Store K and V tensors for each layer after the first forward pass, and reuse them for subsequent tokens. Measure the speedup: generate 200 tokens with and without the cache and compare wall-clock time.

4. Implement top-k sampling (only consider the k highest-probability tokens) and top-p sampling (nucleus sampling: consider the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p). Compare the output quality at temperature 0.8 with top-k=50 vs top-p=0.95.

5. Build a training loss curve plotter. Train the model for 1000 steps and plot loss vs step. Identify the three phases: rapid initial descent (learning common bytes), slower middle phase (learning byte patterns), and plateau (overfitting on the small corpus). The shape of this curve is the same whether you are training a 128-dim model or GPT-4.

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Autoregressive | "It generates one word at a time" | Each output token is conditioned on all previous tokens -- the model predicts P(token_n \| token_0, ..., token_{n-1}) |
| Causal mask | "It can't see the future" | An upper-triangular matrix of -infinity values that prevents attention to future positions during training |
| Multi-head attention | "Multiple attention patterns" | Splitting Q, K, V into parallel heads (e.g., 12 heads of 64 dims each for GPT-2) so each head can learn different relationship types |
| KV Cache | "Caching for speed" | Storing computed Key and Value tensors from previous tokens to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive generation |
| Prefill | "Processing the prompt" | The first inference phase where all prompt tokens are processed in parallel -- compute-bound on GPU FLOPS |
| Decode | "Generating tokens" | The second inference phase where tokens are generated one at a time -- memory-bound on GPU bandwidth |
| Weight tying | "Sharing embeddings" | Using the same matrix for input token embeddings and the output projection head -- saves 38M params in GPT-2 |
| Residual connection | "Skip connection" | Adding the input directly to the output of a sublayer (x + sublayer(x)) -- enables gradient flow in deep networks |
| Layer normalization | "Normalizing activations" | Normalizing across the feature dimension to mean 0 and variance 1, with learnable scale and bias parameters |
| Cross-entropy loss | "How wrong the predictions are" | -log(probability assigned to the correct next token), averaged over all positions -- the standard LLM training objective |
