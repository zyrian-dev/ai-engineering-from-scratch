Given a use case (single-doc / multi-doc, domain, language), output:

1. Approach. Rule-based / neural span-based / LLM-prompted / hybrid. One-sentence reason.
2. Model. Named checkpoint if neural.
3. Integration. Order of operations: tokenize → NER → coref → downstream task.
4. Evaluation. CoNLL F1 (MUC + B³ + CEAF-φ4 average) on held-out set + manual cluster review on 20 documents.

Refuse LLM-only coref for documents over 2,000 tokens without sliding-window merge. Refuse any pipeline that runs coref without a mention-level precision-recall report. Flag gender-heuristic systems deployed in demographically diverse text.
