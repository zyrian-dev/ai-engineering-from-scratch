# POS Tagging and Syntactic Parsing

> Grammar was unfashionable for a while. Then every LLM pipeline needed to validate structured extraction, and it came back.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 · 01 (Text Processing), Phase 2 · 14 (Naive Bayes)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## The Problem

Lesson 01 promised that lemmatization needs a part-of-speech tag. Without knowing `running` is a verb, a lemmatizer cannot reduce it to `run`. Without knowing `better` is an adjective, it cannot reduce to `good`.

That promise hid a whole subfield. Part-of-speech tagging assigns grammatical categories. Syntactic parsing recovers the sentence's tree structure: which word modifies which, which verb governs which arguments. Classical NLP spent twenty years refining both. Then deep learning collapsed them into a token-classification task on top of a pretrained transformer, and the research community moved on.

Not the applied community. Every structured-extraction pipeline still uses POS and dependency trees under the hood. LLM-generated JSON gets validated against grammatical constraints. Question-answering systems decompose queries using dependency parses. Machine translation quality evaluators check alignment of parse trees.

Worth knowing. This lesson introduces the tagsets, the baselines, and the point where you stop implementing from scratch and call spaCy.

## The Concept

![POS tag + dependency parse example](./assets/pos-parse.svg)

**POS tagging** labels each token with a grammatical category. The **Penn Treebank (PTB)** tagset is the English default. 36 tags with distinctions the casual reader finds fussy: `NN` singular noun, `NNS` plural noun, `NNP` proper noun singular, `VBD` verb past tense, `VBZ` verb 3rd person singular present, and so on. The **Universal Dependencies (UD)** tagset is coarser (17 tags) and language-agnostic; it became the default for cross-lingual work.

```
The/DET cats/NOUN were/AUX running/VERB at/ADP 3pm/NOUN ./PUNCT
```

**Syntactic parsing** produces a tree. Two major styles:

- **Constituency parsing.** Noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases nest inside each other. Output is a tree of non-terminal categories (NP, VP, PP) with words as leaves.
- **Dependency parsing.** Each word has a single head word it depends on, labeled with a grammatical relation. Output is a tree where every edge is a (head, dependent, relation) triple.

Dependency parsing won in the 2010s because it generalizes cleanly across languages, especially free-word-order ones.

```
running is ROOT
cats is nsubj of running
were is aux of running
at is prep of running
3pm is pobj of at
```

## Build It

### Step 1: most-frequent-tag baseline

The dumbest POS tagger that works. For each word, predict the tag it had most often in training.

```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict


def train_mft(train_examples):
    word_tag_counts = defaultdict(Counter)
    all_tags = Counter()
    for tokens, tags in train_examples:
        for token, tag in zip(tokens, tags):
            word_tag_counts[token.lower()][tag] += 1
            all_tags[tag] += 1
    word_best = {w: c.most_common(1)[0][0] for w, c in word_tag_counts.items()}
    default_tag = all_tags.most_common(1)[0][0]
    return word_best, default_tag


def predict_mft(tokens, word_best, default_tag):
    return [word_best.get(t.lower(), default_tag) for t in tokens]
```

On the Brown corpus, this baseline hits ~85% accuracy. Not good, but the floor below which no serious model should fall.

### Step 2: bigram HMM tagger

Model the joint probability of the sequence:

```
P(tags, words) = prod P(tag_i | tag_{i-1}) * P(word_i | tag_i)
```

Two tables: transition probabilities (tag given previous tag), emission probabilities (word given tag). Estimate both from counts with Laplace smoothing. Decode with Viterbi (dynamic programming over the tag lattice).

```python
import math


def train_hmm(train_examples, alpha=0.01):
    transitions = defaultdict(Counter)
    emissions = defaultdict(Counter)
    tags = set()
    vocab = set()

    for tokens, ts in train_examples:
        prev = "<BOS>"
        for token, tag in zip(tokens, ts):
            transitions[prev][tag] += 1
            emissions[tag][token.lower()] += 1
            tags.add(tag)
            vocab.add(token.lower())
            prev = tag
        transitions[prev]["<EOS>"] += 1

    return transitions, emissions, tags, vocab


def log_prob(table, given, key, smooth_denom, alpha):
    return math.log((table[given].get(key, 0) + alpha) / smooth_denom)


def viterbi(tokens, transitions, emissions, tags, vocab, alpha=0.01):
    tags_list = list(tags)
    n = len(tokens)
    V = [[0.0] * len(tags_list) for _ in range(n)]
    back = [[0] * len(tags_list) for _ in range(n)]

    for j, tag in enumerate(tags_list):
        em_denom = sum(emissions[tag].values()) + alpha * (len(vocab) + 1)
        tr_denom = sum(transitions["<BOS>"].values()) + alpha * (len(tags_list) + 1)
        tr = log_prob(transitions, "<BOS>", tag, tr_denom, alpha)
        em = log_prob(emissions, tag, tokens[0].lower(), em_denom, alpha)
        V[0][j] = tr + em
        back[0][j] = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j, tag in enumerate(tags_list):
            em_denom = sum(emissions[tag].values()) + alpha * (len(vocab) + 1)
            em = log_prob(emissions, tag, tokens[i].lower(), em_denom, alpha)
            best_prev = 0
            best_score = -1e30
            for k, prev_tag in enumerate(tags_list):
                tr_denom = sum(transitions[prev_tag].values()) + alpha * (len(tags_list) + 1)
                tr = log_prob(transitions, prev_tag, tag, tr_denom, alpha)
                score = V[i - 1][k] + tr + em
                if score > best_score:
                    best_score = score
                    best_prev = k
            V[i][j] = best_score
            back[i][j] = best_prev

    last_best = max(range(len(tags_list)), key=lambda j: V[n - 1][j])
    path = [last_best]
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        path.append(back[i][path[-1]])
    return [tags_list[j] for j in reversed(path)]
```

Bigram HMM on Brown hits ~93% accuracy. The jump from 85% to 93% is mostly transition probabilities — the model learns `DET NOUN` is common and `NOUN DET` is rare.

### Step 3: why modern taggers beat this

Transition + emission probabilities are local. They cannot capture that `saw` is a noun in "I bought a saw" but a verb in "I saw the movie." A CRF with arbitrary features (suffix, word shape, word before and after, word itself) hits ~97%. A BiLSTM-CRF or transformer hits ~98%+.

The ceiling on this task is set by annotator disagreement. Human annotators agree about 97% of the time on Penn Treebank. Models past 98% are probably overfitting the test set.

### Step 4: dependency parsing sketch

Full dependency parsing from scratch is out of scope; the canonical textbook treatment is in Jurafsky and Martin. Two classical families to know:

- **Transition-based** parsers (arc-eager, arc-standard) act like a shift-reduce parser: they read tokens, shift them onto a stack, and apply reduce actions that create arcs. Greedy decoding is fast. Classic implementation is MaltParser. Modern neural version: Chen and Manning's transition-based parser.
- **Graph-based** parsers (Eisner's algorithm, Dozat-Manning biaffine) score every possible head-dependent edge and pick the maximum spanning tree. Slower but more accurate.

For most applied work, call spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("The cats were running at 3pm.")
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text:10s} tag={token.tag_:5s} pos={token.pos_:6s} dep={token.dep_:10s} head={token.head.text}")
```

```
The        tag=DT    pos=DET    dep=det        head=cats
cats       tag=NNS   pos=NOUN   dep=nsubj      head=running
were       tag=VBD   pos=AUX    dep=aux        head=running
running    tag=VBG   pos=VERB   dep=ROOT       head=running
at         tag=IN    pos=ADP    dep=prep       head=running
3pm        tag=NN    pos=NOUN   dep=pobj       head=at
.          tag=.     pos=PUNCT  dep=punct      head=running
```

Read the `dep` column bottom to top and the sentence's grammatical structure falls out.

## Use It

Every production NLP library ships POS and dependency parsers as part of a standard pipeline.

- **spaCy** (`en_core_web_sm` / `md` / `lg` / `trf`). Fast, accurate, integrated with tokenization + NER + lemmatization. `token.tag_` (Penn), `token.pos_` (UD), `token.dep_` (dependency relation).
- **Stanford NLP (stanza)**. Stanford's successor to CoreNLP. State-of-the-art on 60+ languages.
- **trankit**. Transformer-based, good UD accuracy.
- **NLTK**. `pos_tag`. Usable, slow, older. Fine for teaching.

### Where this still matters in 2026

- **Lemmatization.** Lesson 01 needs POS to lemmatize correctly. Always.
- **Structured extraction from LLM outputs.** Validate that a generated sentence respects grammatical constraints (e.g., subject-verb agreement, required modifiers).
- **Aspect-based sentiment.** Dependency parses tell you which adjective modifies which noun.
- **Query understanding.** "movies directed by Wes Anderson starring Bill Murray" decomposes into structured constraints via the parse.
- **Cross-lingual transfer.** UD tags and dependency relations are language-agnostic, enabling zero-shot structured analysis of new languages.
- **Low-compute pipelines.** If you cannot ship a transformer, POS + dependency parse + gazetteer gets you surprisingly far.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/skill-grammar-pipeline.md`:

```markdown
---
name: grammar-pipeline
description: Design a classical POS + dependency pipeline for a downstream NLP task.
version: 1.0.0
phase: 5
lesson: 07
tags: [nlp, pos, parsing]
---

Given a downstream task (information extraction, rewrite validation, query decomposition, lemmatization), you output:

1. Tagset to use. Penn Treebank for English-only legacy pipelines, Universal Dependencies for multilingual or cross-lingual.
2. Library. spaCy for most production, stanza for academic-grade multilingual, trankit for highest UD accuracy. Name the specific model ID.
3. Integration pattern. Show the 3-5 lines that call the library and consume the needed attributes (`.pos_`, `.dep_`, `.head`).
4. Failure mode to test. Noun-verb ambiguity (`saw`, `book`, `can`) and PP-attachment ambiguity are the classical traps. Sample 20 outputs and eyeball.

Refuse to recommend rolling your own parser. Building parsers from scratch is a research project, not an application task. Flag any pipeline that consumes POS tags without handling lowercase/uppercase variants as fragile.
```

## Exercises

1. **Easy.** Using the most-frequent-tag baseline on a small tagged corpus (e.g., NLTK's Brown subset), measure accuracy on held-out sentences. Verify the ~85% result.
2. **Medium.** Train the bigram HMM above and report per-tag precision/recall. Which tags does the HMM confuse most?
3. **Hard.** Use spaCy's dependency parse to extract subject-verb-object triples from a 1000-sentence sample. Evaluate on 50 manually labeled triples. Document where extraction fails (often passives, coordinations, and elided subjects).

## Key Terms

|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| POS tag | Word's type | Grammatical category. PTB has 36; UD has 17. |
| Penn Treebank | Standard tagset | English-specific. Fine-grained verb tenses and noun number. |
| Universal Dependencies | Multilingual tagset | Coarser than PTB; language-neutral; defaults for cross-lingual work. |
| Dependency parse | Sentence tree | Each word has one head, each edge has a grammatical relation. |
| Viterbi | Dynamic programming | Finds the highest-probability tag sequence given emissions and transitions. |
